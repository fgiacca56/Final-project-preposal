## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Idea 1: We have an idea to build a arcade sort of program where the user chooses what games he wants to play out of 2 or 3 choices.  One of the choices is a juke box and then two other games, which we have not figured out yet. 

Idea 2: This idea consists of building a program that can determine from the users input their specific calorie range and macros per day.  This will be based off of height, weight,  and activity level.  

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions at the moment.
